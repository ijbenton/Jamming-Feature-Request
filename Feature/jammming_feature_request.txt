Jammming Feature Request
October 21st 2018

OBJECTIVE
This feature will allow a user to trigger a search by pressing the enter key after typing a search term.
BACKGROUND 
This feature is important because it allows a user the ability to not have to click the search button and instead only use the keyboard to trigger a search. 
This is allows a much cleaner user interface which will keep users more satisfied. It also has potential to provide an easier layout for visually impaired users. 
If the user does not have a mouse it is much more convenient to press the enter button rather than click the search button. 
This feature is used by most websites such as Youtube and Google for example. 
TECHNICAL DESIGN
We start by adding an onKeyPress event attribute to the input element inside SearchBar.js. 
When a key is pressed the handleKeyPress method will be evaluated, taking in the event as an argument. 
A conditional statement checks the key property of the event and sees if it matches ‘Enter’. 
If it does, the search method will be called. This search method is the same one used when the search button is clicked.  
The search method will then call the onSearch method from the SearchBar props and pass in the search term from the current state.
CAVEATS
A potential drawback for this feature is the possibility of adding a new feature that searches the search term without pressing anything. 
This is currently how Spotify’s search bar is set up on their application. 
I prefer triggering the search by an onClick or onKeyPress event attribute because then the application does not have to search every time you type a new character.
